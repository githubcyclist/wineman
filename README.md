# Wine Manager Script - wineman
A simple Bash script to help manage Wine.

Should be compatible with all Linux distros, but it was only tested with Ubuntu.

## Installation
Installation is very easy.

1. Clone the repo to your computer.

2. Open a terminal in the folder which you cloned to, and run "chmod +x wineman".

3. Then use "./wineman" to activate. Optionally, copy it to /usr/bin.
